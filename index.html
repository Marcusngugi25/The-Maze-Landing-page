          The Maze features an indoor environment with textured walls that the
          player can explore and interact with. The room also get affected by
          weather so as to simulate the natural world.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          The Maze is a project to create a 3D based maze game using SDL2(Single
          Directmedia Layer)and Raycasting to render a 2D map into a 3D
          navigable world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creation of this was inspired by my love for computer games that I
          have had since childhood. It was so fascinating to me that entire
          world could be created to fit into a machine that I could access and
          play with. This ended up being the birth of my interest in computers
          and software.
